(To the younger grand seniors)
After chilling with the juniors at open house 2022, Mr Pang, the current 
teacher, invited me to give a sharing on my own experience and what the 
juniors can do to optimise their learning

Beyond this fleeting chance to inspire a love for learning, I hope that my 
attempt to reconnect with a club that is very dear to me also inspires 
other seniors to step up and share their experiences, or any tailored 
knowledge that could strengthen the collective knowledge base of our club. 
But don't feel too pressured to do so! I mean this - I believe stepping up 
naturally when the time is right is most optimal for yourself and for 
others - when your schedules align with the club and when you have more 
head space. (eg. cleared JC, finished BMT, finished difficult school term, 
etc). 

My attempt to reconnect was inspired by (another sch's computing 
school) which has an even stronger club alumni network. In fact, an alumni 
of the school founded an edutech company and regularly 
gives the existing club members opportunities to strengthen their 
knowledge by teaching others. While I may not have the capacity to run 
structured training programs at this current moment, I am inspired to do 
more for my juniors, the club, more consistently and more regularly in my 
own capacity. 

Would also strongly encourage my fellow alumni to share/connect with our 
juniors whenever you can(like what Sanshray is doing, for instance!), 
whenever it feels natural, as we might have domain-specific knowledge that 
the current members may not have, be it in design, tech or even self-care.
