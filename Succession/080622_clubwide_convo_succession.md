##Succession: First club discussion (class of 2014 + 2022-
There is no such thing as perfect succession, perfect transfer of knowledge, **but religiously following some basic processes will help improve information symmetry, and permanently mitigate unnecessary, time-wasting hassles** like `where is the [file]? I can't find it`. The same time could be used to learn, build, or even simply to talk cock and chill.

"As a senior who's left the club for over 8 years, it is quite heartening to see that various members of the club, whether sec2,3 or 4 (sec1 also can care but don't stress ah - the mantle of responsbility mostly lies on the shoulders of the current sec3s, supported by the sec2s, as well as the advisory sec4s) 

While it is indeed possible that bringing in a toxic person could undo all the processes, culture and good feelings the club has spent years to build(like Adolf Hitler, alamak, indeed), **have some faith in yourselves, as current members, to be the check and balance to the club (and yourself)** 

Some bastard could indeed lower morale of the club but for decades, certain traditions have been passed on and the club still remains relatively passionate about learning tech and using tech for good.

Have a little faith in yourselves - all of you were brought in by your seniors. Our senior's judgements are not all perfect, but they did they best they could, to their best of their knowledge at that point in time

If really jialat carelessly the batch vouches for and brings in an asshole, then...migitate it as a team."

```"i literally just realised this repo exists. also  ^a a^ 

but I feel like this is important. As mr Carey has tols us, he (and other seniors) are the past, we are the present, our junoirs are the future 

this allows us to learn from the past and imbue new experiences to those to come"``` ~ proter1132, class of 2023
