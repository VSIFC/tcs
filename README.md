"It's called tea chat session, of course" 

## What's the point of this repo?
- **To democratise "talk cock" sessions, s.t any individual alumni, whether freshly graduated from Mother Victoria, doing major exams, cleared BMT, or doing uni can also join the TCS in light of a relatively volatile new-normal.**  

## Rules 
- vulgarities should only be used for historical accuracy - try to put them in quotes. And do not use any to humiliate, bully, or harass any group or individual. As Mr Low Eng Teong, principal who left in 2011 said: "`Don't cheat, don't steal, don't bully, don't lie`". These implicit values were given before PRIDE values solidified these concepts and ideals that have floated around in the VS community for years. #GPS 
- when giving opinions(instead of facts) speak only for yourself, unless you are **100% sure** that you know the people you represent would endorse your representation of the truth.
- If you're sharing something that could potentially ruin the reputation of the club, write it satirically - write it `undercover mode`, but best shared in person. Like this:
```
Oh you need software but no money as a sec sch student ah? Y'know my dear padawan, 
Legend has it that in the multiverse of the internet, there lies a bay so mystical that the brave and the bold have ventured to...and got what they seeked...
```
- Speak with an intention to add value to the organisation/people. Polite rants are okay but don't go in too deep yo 
- Feel free to screenshot this and share within members of the fraternity - with only past, present or future. But try to quote in context - while unlikely, malicious actors could take things out of context, use the factual patterns against us ligitiously and leave our club in ruins. 

## How to use this repo sia?
- In software, we call this section the Contribution Guide - could come in the form of `CONTRIBUTION.md`, or some subsection in a readme(`.md` extension) in the folder of the creator's choice. Without proper protocols and SOPs, it is likely for people to start yolo-ing their commits, which may not be good for the culture, conscience and constitution of what VSIFC embodies, and has embodied over the past 4-5 decades or so, and will continue to embody. 

## "Schema"
- How this "code base"(in other words, treasure trove) is organised - the root folders are thematically named, ranging from casual topics like:
  -   Culture
  -     eg. our club's unique ninja culture (still exists today)
  -   Meme education, etc. Promotes inter-generational bonding. Haha.
  -   Sports 
  -   Tech
  -   School
Etc! 

To more serious topics that were publicly discussed from time to time by all members, like:
  - Succession 
  (ALL INCOMING BATCH MAKE SURE YOU READ, AND ASK AT LEAST 3 QNS OUT OF CURIOSITY) 
  - Club's public image and brand
  - Efficiency(like ideas that could potentially make our club "better", wtv better means)

## Onboarding Details (How to get started sia)? 
1. Get [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) on your machine: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Clone this repo(aka code base/treasure trove): 
  a. open up [cmd]([https://duckduckgo.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe)) `git clone [repository url]` 
  b. (alternatively) download the GUI version of our version tracking tool, [github desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
3. Choose a text editor of your choice - notepad, notepad++, (microsoft word)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/code-in-docs], sublime text, vs code, the various Jetbrains editors, etc. Or even non-gui, command-line text editors like [VIM](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/vim-dishwashing-liquid-gel-lemon-power-no-residue-grease-250-ml-90132793?gclid=CjwKCAjw7vuUBhBUEiwAEdu2pACfFHFy2CJkOt5FffxDBOOOw50c33kLB89C6qcgCP9X1kiKfH3zLxoC3yQQAvD_BwE), Nano, etc. (But note: if u choose vim, you will have to  struggle and google alot before you learn how to make your first commit, but you will be a legend in the making.) 
3. [make pull-requests on this code base](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/#:~:text=Go%20to%20your%20repository%20on,Congratulations!)
 
 
## Who can change this `README.md`? 
- As mentioned in the traditional Whatsapp group for all members yesterday, the [mantle of responsbility](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Mantle_of_Responsibility) mostly lies on the shoulders of the current sec3s, supported by the sec2s, as well as the advisory sec4s. Then if still cannot solve crisis, its the responsilibility of the current leaders to reach out to the seniors who've walked similar paths before. Invite them for discussion. I am 100% sure statistically, there is minimally 1 alumni every 2 batch would care about the club enough to offer their experience as food for thought, in hopes of helping you mitigate your current crisis. Wtv the crisis may be. If `Mornië alantië`, then stay sanguine, recognise suffering what for it is, gel tgt and defeat the enemy/difficulty, wtv the enemy/difficulty may be.
- TLDR: only current sec3s, sec4s and nominated alumni(by the existing members) can change
